# Project Overview

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is already included and there is an incomplete test suite. The goal is to learn how to use Jasmine by writing tests against a pre-existing application. The tests cover the business logic of the application, event handling and DOM manipulation.
